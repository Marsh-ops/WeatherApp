🌦️ Weather App – Project Summary

This project is a simple and responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.


💡 What I Learned

How APIs work: I learned how to connect a frontend website to an external API and fetch dynamic weather data based on user input (city name).

Working with JSON: I practiced parsing and using JSON data returned from the API to update the webpage.

Asynchronous JavaScript: I used fetch() and async/await to make network requests without freezing the page.

Error handling: I added basic input validation and feedback for users if a city is not found.

Responsive design: I styled the app to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

GitHub Pages: I deployed the project online using GitHub Pages, learning how to share my work publicly.
